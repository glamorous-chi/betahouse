### What I learned

I learned how to build a full stack project from scratch.For this project, I worked with React which is a JavaScript Library, that is used to develop SPAs (Single Page Apllications) which allow for seemless navigation between pages on a website.


### Continued development

I will love to make sure users can see the details of a property they are interested in when they hover or click on the property, and that users can search for a prperty by using the saerch bar in the hero section of the properties page.
